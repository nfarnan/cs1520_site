			<h2>Course Policies</h2>

				<h3>Course Communications</h3>
				<p>
					The instructor and TA will periodically post announcements
					to the course website. It is every student's responsibility
					to regularly monitor these announcements.

					The instructor and TA will periodically email enrolled
					students with announcements. Students must check their Pitt
					email at least once per day to ensure these announcements
					are received.

					When contacting the course staff via email, messages must
					be addressed to (or CC) both the instructor and the TA.
					Email subject should be prefaced with the appropriate 
					prefix (e.g., "[CS15XX]").
				</p>

				<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
				<p>
					All assignment submissions must be the sole work of each
					individual student. Students may not read or copy another
					student's solutions or share their own solutions with other
					students. Students may not review solutions from students
					who have taken the course in previous years. Submissions
					that are substantively similar will be considered cheating
					by all students involved, and as such, students must be
					mindful not to post their code publicly. The use of books
					and online resources is allowed, but must be credited in
					submissions, and material may not be copied verbatim. Any
					use of electronics or other resources during an examination
					
					will be considered cheating.
				</p>
				<p>
					Cheating in this course will result in a grade of F
					for the course and may be subject to further
					disciplinary action.
				</p>
				<!-- Not in A&S any more...
				<p>
					Please read, understand, and abide by the
					<a href="http://www.as.pitt.edu/fac/policies/academic-integrity">Academic Integrity Code</a>
					for the School of Arts and Sciences.
				</p>
				-->

				<h3>Lecture Attendence</h3>
				<p>
					Students are encouraged to attend all lectures, which frequently
					include material that is not directly taken from the text. If a
					student misses a lecture, he/she is still responsible for the
					material covered and is advised to copy the notes from a
					classmate.
				</p>

				<h3>Respectful Discussion</h3>
				<p>
					This course may include open discussion or other
					interactions among students. To allow all participants to
					express their viewpoints, all discussion must remain
					civilized and respectful, and participants must avoid
					comments and behaviors that disparage others. A student who
					feels their viewpoints are not being respected is encouraged
					to contact the instructor, who will work to correct the
					situation without revealing the student's specific concerns
					to the rest of the class. A student in this situation who
					does not feel comfortable contacting the instructor directly
					is encouraged to contact the TA, who will uphold the same
					degree of confidence in relaying the issue to the
					instructor.
				</p>

				<h3>Audio/Video Recordings</h3>
				<p>
					To ensure the free and open discussion of ideas, students
					may not record lectures, discussion or other course
					activities without the advance written permission of the
					instructor. Any recording properly approved in advance can
					be used solely for the student's own personal use.
				</p>

				<h3>Copyrighted Materials</h3>
				<p>
					All course material is subject to copyright, including
					notes, slides, assignments, and solutions. Students are
					allowed to use the provided material only for personal use,
					and may not share the material with others, including
					posting the material on the Web or other file sharing
					venues.
				</p>

				<h3>Collaboration</h3>
				<p>
					We believe that students should be able to distinguish
					between helping one another understand the core concepts of
					the course material and cheating. We encourage students to
					discuss the content of the course in ways that will improve
					understanding without violating academic integrity, such as
					clarifying the objective of an assignment or discussing
					general solution tactics.
				</p>

				<h3>Late Assignments</h3>
				<p>
					All assignments specify a precise due date and time. Late
					assignments will not be accepted. Students must ensure they
					understand each assignment's submission procedure in advance
					of its deadline to ensure that submission difficulties do
					not cause an assignment to be rejected.
				</p>

				<h3>Grade Appeal</h3>
				<p>
					An assignment grade can be appealed up to two weeks after it
					has been returned. After this point, no appeals will be
					considered. When appealing a grade, attach a single-page
					cover sheet that provides a clear description of why you
					feel the assignment was graded unfairly; the <span
					class="emph">entire assignment</span> will be re-graded.
				</p>
				<p>
					The goal of a grade appeal is to ensure a fair and
					consistent score. Thus, a score will not be adjusted on an
					issue of partial credit if the awarded points are consistent
					with the grading policy adopted for the problem for the
					class as a whole.
				</p>
				<p>
					After grades have been posted at the end of the
					term, any further questions or concerns must be
					presented to the instructor in office hours at the
					beginning of the following term.
				</p>

				<h3>Make-up Exams</h3>
				<p>
					Students must be present for all exams.
					Make-up exams will be given <span
					class="emph">only</span> in the event of a <span
					class="emph">documented</span> emergency. The
					instructor must be informed of the emergency in
					advance of, or as soon as possible after, the missed
					exam. Missing an exam under any other
					circumstances will result in a score of 0 for the
					exam.
				</p>
				
				

				<h3>Grade Records</h3>
				<p>
					All graded materials that a student receives back should be
					saved in a safe place until after the term has ended and he/she
					has received and accepts his/her final grade. In this way, any
					grade discrepancies can be easily resolved.
				</p>

				<h3>Students with Disabilities</h3>
				<p>
					If you have a disability for which you are or may be
					requesting an accommodation, you are encouraged to contact
					both your instructor and Disability Resources and Services,
					140 William Pitt Union, 412-648-7890, <a
					href="mailto:drsrecep@pitt.edu">drsrecep@pitt.edu</a>, as
					early as possible in the term. Disability Resources and
					Services will verify your disability and recommend
					reasonable accommodations for this course.
				</p>

				<h3>Religious Observances</h3>
				<p>
					In order to accommodate the observance of religious
					holidays, students should inform the instructor (by email,
					within the first two weeks of the term) of any such days
					which conflict with scheduled class activities.
